# Overview
 This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using SQL.
 It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity 
 The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

# Project Steps
### ✅ Structured Workflow: From exploration → cleaning → analysis → optimization.
### ✅ Progressive Difficulty: Easy, medium, and advanced SQL examples.
### ✅ Actionable Optimization: Indexing, execution plans, and best practices.
### ✅ Real-World Readiness: Export queries for business intelligence tools.

### 1. Data Exploration & Understanding
Before writing queries, it’s essential to understand the dataset’s structure, quality, and key attributes.

### 1.2 Key Attributes
Category	Columns	Description
Core Metadata	Artist, Track, Album, Album_type	Basic track information.
Audio Features	danceability, energy, liveness, tempo, loudness	Spotify's algorithmic metrics.
Performance	Streams, Views, Likes	Popularity indicators.
### 1.3 Data Quality Checks

# 2. Data Preparation & Cleaning
Ensure the dataset is ready for analysis by handling missing values and inconsistencies.
### 2.1 Handling Missing Data
### 2.2 Standardizing Data

# 3. SQL Querying: From Basic to Advanced
### 3.1 Easy Queries (Basic Retrieval & Filtering)
### 3.2 Medium Queries (Aggregations & Grouping)
### 3.3 Advanced Queries (Window Functions, CTEs, Subqueries)


# 4. Performance Optimization
### 4.1 Indexing for Faster Queries
### 4.2 Query Execution Plan Analysis
Optimization Tips:

# Avoid SELECT * → Specify only needed columns.

# Use WHERE before GROUP BY to reduce data early.

# Replace subqueries with JOINs where possible.
